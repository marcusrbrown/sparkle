## 3. Alternatives

- **ALT-001**: Use Jest instead of Vitest for testing consistency - Rejected due to Vitest's superior ESM support and performance
- **ALT-002**: Implement custom bundle analysis instead of webpack-bundle-analyzer - Rejected due to maintenance overhead and proven tool maturity
- **ALT-003**: Use Cypress instead of Playwright for E2E testing - Rejected due to existing Playwright investment and superior cross-browser support
- **ALT-004**: Build custom monitoring solution instead of leveraging existing tools - Rejected in favor of proven open-source solutions and faster implementation
- **ALT-005**: Use third-party monitoring services instead of self-hosted dashboard - Rejected to maintain data privacy and reduce external dependencies
