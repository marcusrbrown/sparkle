# Sparkle

> Sparkle is an experimental TypeScript playground focused on modern web and mobile development technologies, featuring a monorepo with packages for UI components, utilities, mobile applications, and development tools built with React, Vite, Expo, and React Native.

This is a personal development playground that demonstrates modern monorepo architecture using pnpm workspaces and Turborepo. The repository includes a React Native mobile app (fro-jive), a comprehensive UI component library, shared utilities, and extensive development tooling with Storybook for component documentation.

The project emphasizes TypeScript-first development, comprehensive testing, and maintainable code architecture. It serves as both a learning environment and a foundation for building production-ready applications using cutting-edge web and mobile technologies.
