- Use strict null checks to prevent null or undefined errors
- Prefer interfaces over types for better extensibility
- Utilize type guards and assertions for runtime type checking
- Implement proper type inference to reduce unnecessary type annotations
- Leverage TypeScript's utility types (e.g., Partial, Readonly) for cleaner code
