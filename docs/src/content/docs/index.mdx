## Quick Start

```bash
# Install Sparkle packages
pnpm add @sparkle/ui @sparkle/theme @sparkle/types

# Start using components
import { Button } from '@sparkle/ui'
import { ThemeProvider } from '@sparkle/theme'

function App() {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme="light">
      <Button variant="primary">Get Started</Button>
    </ThemeProvider>
  )
}
```

## Package Architecture

Sparkle is organized as a monorepo with focused packages:

- **[@sparkle/ui](/components/overview/)** - React component library
- **[@sparkle/theme](/theme/overview/)** - Design tokens and theme providers
- **[@sparkle/types](/types/overview/)** - Shared TypeScript definitions
- **[@sparkle/utils](/utils/overview/)** - Utility functions and React hooks
- **[@sparkle/error-testing](/error-testing/overview/)** - Error testing framework

## Development Workflow

The Sparkle monorepo uses modern tooling for an optimal developer experience:

- **pnpm workspaces** for efficient dependency management
- **Turborepo** for fast, cached builds
- **Storybook** for component development and testing
- **Vitest** for unit and integration testing
- **Playwright** for visual regression testing
