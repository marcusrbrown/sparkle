description: Comprehensive accessibility guidelines and WCAG 2.1 AA compliance information for the Sparkle Design System documentation.
---

The Sparkle Design System documentation is committed to providing an accessible experience for all users, including those using assistive technologies.

## Our Accessibility Commitment

We strive to conform to the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/) Level AA standards. These guidelines help ensure our documentation is accessible to people with disabilities and provides a better user experience for everyone.

## Accessibility Features

### ‚å®Ô∏è Keyboard Navigation

- **Tab Navigation**: All interactive elements can be accessed using the Tab key
- **Focus Indicators**: Clear visual focus indicators meet WCAG contrast requirements
- **Skip Links**: Skip navigation links allow users to jump to main content
- **Logical Tab Order**: Focus moves through elements in a logical sequence

### üéØ Screen Reader Support

- **Semantic HTML**: Proper use of headings, lists, and landmarks
- **ARIA Labels**: Enhanced labels for complex interactive elements
- **Alt Text**: Descriptive alternative text for all informative images
- **Live Regions**: Dynamic content changes are announced to screen readers

### üé® Visual Design

- **Color Contrast**: Text meets WCAG AA contrast ratios (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
- **Color Independence**: Information is not conveyed by color alone
- **Responsive Design**: Content adapts to different screen sizes and zoom levels
- **Focus Styles**: Clear focus indicators with 3:1 contrast ratio

### üì± Mobile Accessibility

- **Orientation Support**: Functions work in both portrait and landscape modes
- **Zoom Support**: Content remains functional when zoomed to 200%

## Testing Tools and Methods

### Automated Testing

We use several automated tools to continuously monitor accessibility:

- **axe-core**: Industry-standard accessibility testing engine
- **Lighthouse**: Google's built-in accessibility auditing
- **WAVE**: Web accessibility evaluation tool

### Manual Testing

Our manual testing process includes:

- **Keyboard Navigation**: Testing all functionality without a mouse
- **Screen Reader Testing**: Verification with NVDA, VoiceOver, and ORCA
- **Color Contrast Analysis**: Ensuring proper contrast ratios
- **Zoom Testing**: Verifying functionality at 200% zoom

## Browser and Assistive Technology Support

### Supported Browsers

- Chrome (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Edge (latest)

### Supported Screen Readers

- **NVDA** (Windows) - Free screen reader

## Known Issues and Limitations

We are aware of the following accessibility considerations:

- **Dynamic Content**: Some interactive examples may require additional screen reader navigation
- **Code Examples**: Syntax highlighting may reduce contrast in some cases
- **Third-party Embeds**: Storybook embeds inherit their own accessibility features
