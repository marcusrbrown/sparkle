description: Test page for verifying Astro Islands React integration with Sparkle components

import ReactIntegrationDemo from '../../../components/ReactIntegrationDemo.astro'

This page demonstrates that Astro Islands React integration is working correctly with Sparkle UI components.

## Interactive Button Demo

<ReactIntegrationDemo />

## Features Demonstrated

- ✅ **Astro Islands**: React components render on the client side
- ✅ **@sparkle/ui Integration**: Sparkle Button components work within Astro
- ✅ **Interactive State**: React state management and event handling
- ✅ **TypeScript Support**: Full type safety for React components
- ✅ **Styling Integration**: Components render with proper styling

## Technical Details

This integration enables:

1. **Client-side Hydration**: React components are hydrated on the client
2. **Selective Interactivity**: Only components marked with `client:load` are interactive
3. **Optimal Performance**: Static content remains static, interactive islands are hydrated as needed
4. **Component Reusability**: Sparkle components work seamlessly in both Astro and React contexts

## Configuration

The React integration is configured in `astro.config.mjs`:

```js
import react from '@astrojs/react'
import starlight from '@astrojs/starlight'

export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [
    react(),
    starlight({
      // Starlight configuration
    })
  ]
})
```

## Component Usage

React components can be used in Astro with hydration directives:

```tsx
// Import the React component
import { ButtonDemo } from './components/demos/ButtonDemo'

// Use with client-side hydration
<ButtonDemo client:load />
```
