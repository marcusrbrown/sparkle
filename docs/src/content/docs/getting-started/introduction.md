## Architecture Overview

Sparkle is organized as a **pnpm workspace** with focused packages that work together seamlessly:

```text
@sparkle/
├── ui/           # 🎨 React component library
├── theme/        # 🌈 Design tokens and theme providers
├── types/        # 📝 Shared TypeScript definitions
├── utils/        # 🔧 Utility functions and React hooks
├── error-testing/# 🧪 Error testing framework
└── config/       # ⚙️ Shared build configurations
```

### Smart Dependencies

Each package has clear responsibilities and minimal dependencies:

```text
@sparkle/ui
├── @sparkle/theme     # ← Design tokens & theming
├── @sparkle/types     # ← TypeScript definitions
└── @sparkle/utils     # ← Shared utilities

@sparkle/theme
└── @sparkle/types     # ← Core type definitions

@sparkle/utils
└── @sparkle/types     # ← Type safety everywhere
```

This architecture means you can:

- **Install only what you need** - Use just `@sparkle/theme` for design tokens
- **Avoid circular dependencies** - Clean, predictable import paths
- **Scale confidently** - Add new packages without breaking existing ones
- **Update incrementally** - Each package versions independently
