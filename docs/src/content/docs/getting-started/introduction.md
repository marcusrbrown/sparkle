Welcome to Sparkle, a comprehensive TypeScript-first design system built for modern web and mobile applications. Sparkle provides a unified approach to building beautiful, accessible, and consistent user interfaces across platforms.

## Design Philosophy

Sparkle is built around several core principles:

### TypeScript-First

Every component, utility, and design token in Sparkle is designed with TypeScript in mind. This provides:

- **Type Safety**: Catch errors at compile time rather than runtime
- **Better Developer Experience**: Rich IntelliSense and autocomplete
- **Self-Documenting APIs**: Types serve as living documentation
- **Refactoring Confidence**: Safe large-scale changes with confidence

### Cross-Platform Consistency

Sparkle's design token system ensures visual consistency between:

- **React Web Applications** using CSS custom properties
- **React Native Mobile Apps** using StyleSheet values
- **Storybook Documentation** for component development

### Accessibility by Default

All Sparkle components are built with accessibility as a core requirement:

- **WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance** out of the box
- **Screen Reader Support** with proper ARIA labels
- **Keyboard Navigation** for all interactive elements
- **Focus Management** with visible focus indicators

### Developer Productivity

Sparkle optimizes for developer productivity through:

- **Comprehensive Tooling**: Storybook, testing utilities, and build tools
- **Automated Testing**: Visual regression testing and accessibility audits
- **Documentation**: Auto-generated API docs and interactive examples
- **Monorepo Structure**: Efficient development and maintenance

## Architecture Overview

Sparkle is organized as a pnpm workspace with focused packages:

```text
packages/
├── ui/           # React component library
├── theme/        # Design tokens and theme providers
├── types/        # Shared TypeScript definitions
├── utils/        # Utility functions and React hooks
├── error-testing/# Error testing framework
└── config/       # Shared build configurations
```
